## 11/3/2025 - made the circuit and a few games  

I made a simple circuit where I connected a 128x64 lcd to the raspberry pi pico also adding a few buttons for the controls. I used a ssh106 driver for the oled display and micropython on the microcontroller.![PXL_20251103_233227063](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e2d0e9a0a33e34009ccf763eadf28275518f1028/PXL_20251103_233227063.jpg)

I also made an implementation of breakout and snake.
